# ML-Project
The main purpose of this project was to apply all classification, clustering, and dimension reduction methods (from scikit-learn library) learned through the ML course in our master studies (Fall2018). The data was gathered from cell phone sensors and the task was to predict individual activities based on the signals (walking, sitting, standing, etc).

The classification methods include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost, SVM, and 2-layer Neural Nets. For the feature selection part I used Tree-based feature selection.

The clustering methods also include K-means and GMM. The PCA is used for the dimonsion reduction part.
